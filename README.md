# CSX415 Final Project

*PROJECTS ARE DUE BEFORE THE LAST CLASS*

This repository is your repository for containing all assets for your 
final project. It should include all supporting documentation, code, 
reports and (possibly) the data to run your project. You should have figured 
out what your need to produce. 

You should replace this README.md file with a proper README.md of your fork of 
the [project](https://github.com/csx415/project). Your should name your fork 
`csx415-project` so that it can be easily be found.

Much of the deliverables were completed during the course. If they were, you 
can simply move them from the assignments folder here.  Make sure that you 
respond to the feedback that was provided.


# Background 

A completed project should have a full history (thanks git!) and should be 
fully-encapsulated (i.e. it has everythjnig needed by the project). There are 
three types of projects assets: 

* documentation and reports
* data
* code

It is necessary to manage all these components in a standard-ish way so that 
the project can be managed by any competent data scientist. This means 
preparing and documenting your project in predicatable and repeatable ways. The 
`GRADE.md` provides what should be included in the project as well as how the 
project should be evaluated.
